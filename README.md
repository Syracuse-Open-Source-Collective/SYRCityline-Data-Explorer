# ‚öôÔ∏è Technology

SYRCityline Data Explorer is powered by advanced technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. It utilizes [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), a powerful JavaScript library, to establish communication with the Discord API. This integration enables the bot to efficiently interact with users on the Discord platform, providing a reliable and intuitive interface for accessing SYRCityline request data.

To retrieve data from the SYRCityline API, the bot relies on [superagent](https://github.com/ladjs/superagent), a popular HTTP client library in JavaScript. Superagent facilitates seamless requests to the [SYRCityline API](https://data.syr.gov/datasets/0d58a53ccb22457990161d756ed8a870_0/api) which uses [Arcgis](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/), allowing the bot to fetch the latest information about service requests made within Syracuse.
